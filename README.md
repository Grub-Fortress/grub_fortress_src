# Wanna help? join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NM82mujJsf).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Collection of changes that could end up in LIVE-TF2, the goal is to try making as much stuff as possible less hardcoded, to give mappers and vscripters more customization like, Custom map titles, killicons, and so on.
> ## This is also meant to be as a "Playground" build, demonstating how TF2 could function with community fixes and such, this is just for fun feel free to fork, or use

> [!WARNING]
> - Features some community fixes which i DO NOT CLAIM as mine, but credited (if we forgot please reach us on Discord).
> - Feel free to use my code for your own mods! i just wanted to improve TF2 a little, and add custom stuff.
> - More coders may be needed (i am not a full expert coder, but i try my best).
